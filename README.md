Frontend web development

#Notes on Development
This project uses Blendid https://github.com/vigetlabs/blendid for front end task running
Just follow to following steps if you need to get started

If you have yarn installed:
yarn init
yarn add blendid
yarn run blendid -- init
yarn run blendid

One issiue that I noticed is that the Fonts folder aren't copied into the dist folder in the gulp task for the public folder so you'regoing to have to do this manually (everything else seems to work).
